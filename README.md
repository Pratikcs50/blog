The project is solely based on my individual interst.

The project is based on :
    1)FRONTEND : html, css, bootstrap and w3school css
    2)BACKEND : flask python framework
    3)DATABASE : sqlite3 incorporated with SQLAlchemy model

The project is a multipage website linked dynamically. With a database linked too to get the information of the bloggers and user who want to contribute.
Currently the website is under development and at first I have decided to make it as my college project but now I am thinking of developing it as a 
full fledge blogging site.
